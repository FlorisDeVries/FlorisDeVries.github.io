Hi all!
<br/><br/>
A bit of a shorter blog this time around... And months over due... But also a new start to continue working on my main project!
<br>
On my portfolio page I added a new project these past two months, a project about a mini-game created for my brother. For this project I created a 2d platformer about him saving his fiancee from the virus.
In this short blog post I briefly want to show some of the features added.

        This was one of the first actual 2D game I created in Unity and therefore I had to get used to a number of Unity featues. 
        The most easy where the physics and general game logic, which I already had used in the 3D environments.
        <br>
        The most interesting was the actual use of tilemaps and tile palettes. 
        These were not completely unfamiliar to me, but still I hadn't had the chance yet to try them out in a 2D Unity environment. 
        After some testing and googling I managed to create some tile-brushes which made it possible to easily design and create my worlds.

      In the game the player as said has to avoid the virus, which is represented by goomba-like enemies. 
      With a really simple design they just patrol between two points, die when jumped on and will bump the player when colliding. This already creates some really challenging segments.
      <br>
      There are also some collectibles, like hearts for healing, ripple as a form of coins/score. And of course the main objectives: The ring and the fiancee, who is initially locked in a cage.

Since this blog should be mostly about the Temple of Bastet project I will end this dev log here, even though there are numerous details I could go on about for a while longer.
As for next weeks/months I will continue working on Temple of Bastet as before! So next dev log should contain some art upgrades and maybe even more...
