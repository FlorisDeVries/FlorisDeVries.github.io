        Hello there!
        <br><br>
        Welcome to my portfolio website for all my game dev and game design projects! I am a software engineer, game developer and game designer currently working as a Technical Consultant at <a href="https://www.dynatos.com/">Dynatos</a>.
        <br>
        Before I got my job as a Technical Consultant I finished my MSc(Game and Media Technology) and BSc(Game Technology) in computer science where I gained experience in a number of languages including C# and Unity.
        During my BSc I also aqcuired skills in Game Design by following a minor programme at the HKU (University of the Arts Utrecht),
        followed by several passion projects.
        <br><br>
        Even though I focussed on C# and Unity, I've also learned to use other languages. A short summary of these
        languages in no particular order would be: C++, Python, Haskell, Kotlin, HTML, css, sql, and PHP.
        With these languages I have completed a wide variety of projects from training a pacman AI to beat it's own game to
        implementing an interactive real-time ray tracer and path tracer.
        <br><br>
        When I'm not busy working, or creating my own games, I love to play games or watch series. Rocket league is a game that keeps facinating me,
        since it appears to have an infinite skill ceiling and almost more unintential mechanics than intended once. 
        For me this is a great example of great game design, where players are given the freedom to experiment and come up with their own approach to tackle a problem, a.k.a. score a goal.
        <br>
        Other games/genres that I really enjoy are: TD(Dungeon defenders), RTS(AoE, C&C, SC2), FPS, Puzzle-games, and
        simulation/building games(Factorio, CIV, AoW). These kind of games appeal to me mostly because of the their challenging nature.
        I thoroughly enjoy improving my skills and challenging myself to reach the next level, especially when competition is involved.
