Hello there!
<br><br>
Welcome to my portfolio website, showcasing my game development and design projects! I'm a software engineer and game
developer,
currently working as a Technical Consultant at <a href="https://www.dynatos.com/">Dynatos</a>.
<br><br>
My academic background includes an MSc in Game and Media Technology and a BSc in Game Technology, both in computer
science,
where I specialized in C# and Unity. My skill set also extends to C++, Python, Haskell, Kotlin, HTML, CSS, SQL, and PHP.
These languages have enabled me to complete diverse projects, ranging from AI development to real-time ray tracing.
<br><br>
My journey in game development began with a minor in Game Design at the HKU (University of the Arts Utrecht), followed
by several passion projects.
While I'm deeply engaged in my professional work and personal game development ventures, I also find time to enjoy
various games.
I appreciate titles that offer a blend of challenge and creativity, like Rocket League, TD (Dungeon Defenders), RTS (Age
of Empires, Command & Conquer, StarCraft II), FPS,
puzzle games, and simulation/building games (Factorio, Civilization, Age of Wonders).
