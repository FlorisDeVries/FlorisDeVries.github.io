        Hello there!
        <br><br>
        I am a (game) developer, game designer, and also currently enrolled in the Game and Media Technology MSc programme at Utrecht University.
        <br>
        Before enrolling in the MSc programme I finished my BSc in computer science (Game Technology) where I gained experience in a number of languages including C# and Unity.
        During that time I also aqcuired skills in the Game Design by following a minor programme at the HKU (University of the Arts Utrecht),
        followed by several passion projects.
        <br><br>
        Even though I focussed on C# and Unity, I've also learned to use other languages. A short summary of these
        languages in no particular order would be: Python, Haskell, Kotlin, HTML, css, sql, and PHP.
        During the master's programme C++ was introduced to me. And even though I've become more proficient with the
        language and see some of its benefits, C# would still be my preferred language to use.
        With these languages I have completed a wide variety of projects from training a pacman AI to beat it's own game to
        implementing an interactive real-time ray tracer and path tracer.
        <br><br>
        When I'm not busy working or studying I love to play games or watch series. Rocket league is a game that keeps facinating me,
        with an infinite skill ceiling and more unintended mechanics being "discovered" now and
        then. Plus let's face it... who doesn't love ramming their car into a ball and then flying off with it?
        <br>
        Other games/genres that I really enjoy are: TD(Dungeon defenders), RTS(AoE, C&C, SC2), FPS, Puzzle-games, and
        simulation/building games(Factorio, CIV, AoW). These kind of games appeal to me mostly because of the their challenging nature.
        I thoroughly enjoy improving my skills and challenging myself to reach the next level, especially when competition is involved.
