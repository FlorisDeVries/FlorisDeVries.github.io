Hi there!

I am Master's student at Utrecht University, currently enrolled in the Game and Media Technology MSc programme. I have already finsished my BSc in computer science where I have learned mostly about working with C# and Unity. During that time I also aqcuired skills in the Game Design part of Game Development by doing a minor at the HKU, followed by several passion projects.

Even though I mostly learned about C# and Unity, I've also used other languages. A short summary of these languages would be: Python, Haskell, Kotlin, HTML, css, and PHP.
During the master's programme C++ was introduced to me. Even though I've become more proficient with the language, C# would still be my preferred language to use.
With these languages I have completed a wide variety of projects from training an agent to walk with AI to implementing an interactive real-time ray tracer and path tracer.

When I'm not busy working or studying I love to play games or watch series. I'll always find Rocket league interesting to play, with an infinite skill ceiling and more unintended mechanics being "discovered" so now and then. Plus let's face it... who doesn't love ramming their car into a ball and then flying off with it?
Other games/genres that I really enjoy are: RTS(AoE, C&C, SC2), FPS, Puzzle-games, and simulation/building games(Factorio, CIV, AoW).
