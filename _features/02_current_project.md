# Temple of Bastet
[Temple of Bastet](https://bitbucket.org/FlorisDeVries/templeofbastet/) is my current hobby project. This project is meant to be a fun and learnfull experiment to further extend my game design and game development skills.
The games main focus is around defending and expanding your treasure. You, as the player, want to raid as many temples as possible to collect more and more powerful artifacts, which in turn can be used to build better defences around your treasure, or power up your character. While raiding temples you need to ensure you find a safe exit route, because once you have found the artifacts you need to make a run for it!

I am planning on showing my progress and struggles in a montly update in [this blog](blog).
