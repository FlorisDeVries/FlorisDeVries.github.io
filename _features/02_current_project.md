# Tower Defence RPG
[TDRPG](https://github.com/FlorisDeVries/TDRPG) is my current hobby project that I just started. I'm creating this game just for my own pleasure :D
Most of the game concepts are still fairly vague, however the main core mechanic is what I'll be focussing on. I want to create an RPG game, where the player can spawn towers to defend himself and some objectives, combined with a chaotic hack and slash feel... This for me means that the player will also have the ability to fight!
My focus for this project is creating a solid game loop, getting the game feel right, and making sure most things interact with eachother for more engaging gameplay :)
