# Tower Defence RPG
[TDRPG](https://github.com/FlorisDeVries/TDRPG) is my current hobby project that I just started. This nameless game is purely a hobby project of mine, used to learn more about game development in Unity and work on a game, which I myself would really enjoy.
Most of the game concepts are still somewhat vague, however the main core mechanic is something that I want to focus on. The intent is for the game to become an RPG game, where the player can spawn towers to defend himself and some objectives, combined with a chaotic hack and slash feel. For me this means that the player will also have the ability to fight!
My current focus is creating a solid game loop, getting the game feel right, and making sure most things interact with eachother for more engaging gameplay :)
