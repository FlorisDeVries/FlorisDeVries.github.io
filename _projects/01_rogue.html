This is the first real game project I worked on at uni! Together with 4 other students we got the task to take an old game and upgrade one aspect of the game.
For this we chose "Rogue" and decided to add 2.5D graphics and sprites as upgrade. 
For the project I had picked up AI-behaviour (e.g. path finding (A*)) and the combat/turn system. I worked with the following students on the game:
<a href="http://www.ncmulder.me">Niels Mulder</a>, <a href="https://github.com/MarijnS95">Marijn Suijten</a>, Steven Luiten, and Noud Liefrink.
