This is the first real game project I worked on during my bachelor's degree, which took place during my first semester of college. 
Together with 4 other students we got the assignment to take an old game and upgrade one aspect of the game to create a more modern version.
For this we chose "Rogue" and decided to add 2.5D graphics and sprites as upgrade. 
During project I worked on the AI-behaviour (e.g. path finding (A*)) and the combat/turn system. The following students were on my team:
<a href="http://www.ncmulder.me">Niels Mulder</a>, <a href="https://github.com/MarijnS95">Marijn Suijten</a>, Steven Luiten, and Noud Liefrink.
