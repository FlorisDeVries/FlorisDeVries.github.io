In my first year at uni we had to create a RayTracer. This was one of the first projects I was proud of... visually speaking.
The performance would be what you would expect when building your first RayTracer, with minimal experience in coding efficient.
For the course (called Graphics) we alse created a rasterizer, with some spinning teapots. These project where done together with: 
<a href="http://www.ncmulder.me">Niels Mulder</a> and <a href="https://github.com/MarijnS95">Marijn Suijten</a>. 
Since this was an uni assignment I won't be able to share the source code, which might be a good thing for me...
