During the Game design minor we had to create a couple of games, most of which evolved around a simple challenge.
For this game we had to create a game for the blind, i.e. a game without any visuals.
Together with <a href="https://github.com/szatben">Ben</a> I decided to create a game where the player has to defeat an enless horde of aliens.
This can be done by using stereo sound to indicate where the enemies are located, and other auditory cues to inform the player when he is looking at an alien.
Due to the limitations of the assignment the player's movement was limited to 1 dimensional rotations, even though the game was created in 3D.
