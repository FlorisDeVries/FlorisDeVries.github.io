During the Game Design minor a gamejam was held, for the duration of a week. Together with <a href="https://github.com/Roxanne13579">Roxanne Giling</a> I created a Mars exploration game in this gamejam, where the player controls curiosity and has to research some rocks on mars... 
Exciting right? Well there might just be something more to it...
