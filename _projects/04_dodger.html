This is a solo project where I tried making a really simple game within a limited amount of time with the sole purpose of actually publishing a game! Well guess what: I both somewhat finished the game as well as published it to the play store!
The game is about a ball trying to survive an invasion of balls in his simple square house. I know right? Impeccable story writing and game desing right there!
