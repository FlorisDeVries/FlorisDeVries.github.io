Every year around december my family and I create some sort of "surprise" for another family member. 
Due to some rule changes in regards to the previous years I was, from this year forwards, allowed to also create some piece of software.
For this years surprise I had to create something for the boyfriend of one of my sisters. Since one of the main interest was music and sound, 
for which he was also studying at the time, I decided to create a program that would respond to real-time audio as recorded by the mic.
The program had two modes: One in which the poem was integrated with this system (making the letters dance) and one with a box filled with balls.
To make it more interesting different letters react to different tones of voice, so when the reader would read out the poem the letters would dance.
The project can be found <a href="https://github.com/FlorisDeVries/AudioVisualiser">here</a>.
