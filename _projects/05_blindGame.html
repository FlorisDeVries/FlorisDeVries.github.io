During the game design minor we had the challenge to create a blind game, i.e. a game without visuals. Together with <a href="https://github.com/szatben">Ben</a> I created a game where the player has to defeat an enless horde of aliens.
The player gets dropped on a planet filled with aliens, and with auditory cues the player need to find out where the aliens are and shoot them! Check out the project <a href="https://github.com/FlorisDeVries/GameAudio">here</a>!
