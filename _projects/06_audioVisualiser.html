Every year around december my family and I create some sort of "surprise" for another family member. 
At first this was supposed to be an actual artisitic creation (so crafting something with cardboard boxes for me...). 
However we changed that rule to where I can now create anything I want... So I could also build some fancy simulation/interactive app :D
The first of these which I created is an poem and box of balls that react to incoming audio. 
So when the lucky reader gets to read the poem all the letters respond to his voice. To make it interesting different letters react to different tones of voice.
This project was created for the BF of my sister and can be found <a href="https://github.com/FlorisDeVries/AudioVisualiser">here</a>.
