During the same minor we were challenged by filling in an assignment all by ourselves, focussing on our own development. 
Since most projects I had done at the time were never really finished due to deadlines, I decided that I wanted to pickup a small project.
The goal of the project being to finish and publish any sort of game, even though we only had a week to accomplish this.
Since publishing something was completely new to me I had to work a few late nights, however I did achieve my goal at the end:
The game is about a ball trying to survive an invasion of balls in his simple square house.
Which is truly impeccable story writing and game design (I think).
