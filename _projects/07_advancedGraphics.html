In the course AdvancedGraphics we learned more in depth about different render techniques, with the focus on path tracing. 
During this course we had to create a PathTracer, which I did together with <a href="http://www.ncmulder.me">Niels Mulder</a>. 
This was before the RTX GPUs were available, so the path tracing is all done on CPU, but after implementing all kinds of acceleration techniques the path tracer was just about real-time at the end!
Since this was a uni assignment I won't be linking the source code here...
