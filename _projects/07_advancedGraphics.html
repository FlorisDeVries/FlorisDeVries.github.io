During the master's programme I have followed a couple of intersting courses, Advanced Graphics was one of the most interesting with a rewarding practicum.
In this course we learned in depth about different render techniques, with the focus on path tracing.
For the assignment we had to create a PathTracer, which I did together with <a href="http://www.ncmulder.me">Niels Mulder</a>. 
This was before the RTX GPUs were available, so the path tracing is all done on CPU. 
This resulted in some really slow render times at first, 
but after implementing all kinds of acceleration techniques the path tracer ended up with more frames per second than seconds per frame.
