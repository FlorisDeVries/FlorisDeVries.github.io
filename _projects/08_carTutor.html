The second year of creating games as a "surprise" I had drawn my little brother. He just started to take driving lessons, 
so I had found a source of inspiration and decided to teach him to drive a car... in a more safe and forgiving environment. 
Just like any regular driving lesson you had to control a car and collect gems, while avoiding the usual obstacles like flaming barrels, trees and cars.
