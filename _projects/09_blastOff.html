For the course "Game Physics" during the master's programme <a href="http://www.ncmulder.me">Niels Mulder</a> and I implemented a simulation of the solar system in Unity using our own physics.
To make the "game" a game we also created a level system where the player has to try and shoot a rocket from one planet to another within a less accurate simulation... 
Otherwise the player would have to get very lucky to hit the planet. 
We also included a sandbox mode in which the player can create their own solar system with complete freedom (multiple suns are a possibility).
