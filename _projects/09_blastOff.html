For the course "Game Physics" <a href="http://www.ncmulder.me">Niels Mulder</a> and I implemented a simulation of the solar system in Unity ...with our own physics.
To make the "game" a game we also created a level system where the player has to try and shoot a rocket from one planet to another within a less accurate simulation... Would be waaaay to difficult to play otherwise :). 
And as a cherry on the cake we also included a sandbox mode in which you can try and create your very own solar system! 
You could even try to make one with multiple suns?? Check it out <a href="https://www.github.com/FlorisDeVries/INFOMGP_Project">here</a>!
