This is the third game project that I did for the yearly creative "surprise", this time for one of my sisters.
Since she really likes birds (and has a couple), combined with the mouse home-invasion she had at the time, I saw only one logical solution:
Create a tower defence game, where mice try and get to your "main" bird. The player can defend by building bird towers/turrets.
I also included an improved version of the solar system simulation found in "Blast Off!" since her graduation project was about exploring space.
