To learn more about unity and compute shaders I messed around a bit in Unity and followed some really great tutorials on the subject. 
One of the more interesting tutorials I found, which really helped me understand the inner workings of compute shaders and Unity, was a tutorial on <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/gpu-ray-tracing-in-unity-part-1">Ray and Path tracing</a>.
I always found ray and path tracing interesting, even though it can be challenging at times, so this was the perfect tutorial for me. 
After completing the tutorial I implemented some extra features and ensured the Unity project had some clean structure to it (so I could easily swap scenes/render techniques).

Even though I am for now done with this project, I am sure I will revisit it once again in the future to add more features! Check out the source code <a href="https://github.com/FlorisDeVries/TracersComputeShaders">here</a>.
