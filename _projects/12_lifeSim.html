This year I drew my brother for the Saint Nicholas surprise. It had been a long time since I drew him for this tradition, so I again wanted to create some fun mini-game.
The biggest things that had happened previous year were him getting engaged and the whole world breaking down over the virus. That's why I decided the main theme of the game should be about him saving his fiancee from the virus and bring her her ring!
<br>
I had quite a few more ideas to put into the game, but since it was a really short mini-project I did not get to finishing those. For a short project I am quite fond of what I have achieved though, in my blog I made a short post about this game since it halted some of the progress of my main project.
