The "Audio Visualiser" project was a unique and playful piece of software I created as part of my family’s yearly tradition of crafting surprises for one another. This year, I developed an interactive program for the boyfriend of one of my sisters, whose passion for music and sound inspired the concept. The project became a fun sandbox experience where various game elements reacted dynamically to audio input.


### Features and Mechanics
The program utilized the microphone of my laptop to capture real-time audio, interpreting musical notes and voice tones to create visually engaging effects. Key features included:
- **Interactive Poetry Mode**: A custom poem was integrated into the program. Letters "danced" in response to the reader's voice, with different tones causing varying reactions.
- **Sandbox Mode**: A physics-based environment where players could explore a box filled with balls, each reacting differently to sound inputs.
- **Audio Visualizer**: Musical notes and voice tones were analyzed in real-time, causing distinct objects to respond based on their pitch and intensity.

### Technical Challenges and Learnings
This project pushed me to dive deeper into Unity’s **audio systems**, **prefabs**, and **shaders**, particularly in:
- Capturing and processing real-time microphone input.
- Analyzing audio frequencies to map specific tones to game objects.
- Designing responsive visual effects that enhanced the interactive experience.

### Outcome
The end result was a fun and creative sandbox that received positive feedback from its intended recipient. While the project didn’t have a clear gameplay goal, its charm lay in its interactive and experimental nature, showcasing the dynamic interplay between audio and visuals.
