**Bird Attack** was the third game I created as part of my family’s yearly "surprise" tradition. This year, I designed a game for one of my sisters, combining her love for birds with a playful nod to a recent mouse invasion in her home. The result was a quirky tower defense game where players use bird turrets to fend off waves of attacking mice, all while protecting their “main bird.”

### Gameplay and Features
- **Tower Defense Mechanics**: Players strategically place bird towers to defeat waves of invading mice.
- **Space Simulation Tie-in**: Included an improved version of the solar system simulation from my earlier project, *Blast Off!*, as a tribute to her graduation project on space exploration.

### Challenges and Learnings
This project presented a fun challenge of creating an enjoyable game within a limited timeframe, as it was primarily developed over weekends. To accelerate the process, I followed [Brackeys’ Tower Defense tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beuoNuK2tbk&list=PLPV2KyIb3jR4u5jX8za5iU1cqnQPmbzG0&ab_channel=Brackeys), which provided invaluable guidance for implementing core mechanics.

Key takeaways from this project include:
- **Unity Package Manager and Asset Store**: Learned to effectively utilize external tools and assets to speed up development without compromising creativity.
- **External Learning**: Embraced the use of tutorials and resources to expand my skill set and solve problems efficiently.
- **Rapid Iteration**: Improved my ability to scope, design, and execute a game within tight deadlines.

### Reception
The end result was a quirky, lighthearted game that brought a lot of joy to my sister, fulfilling its purpose perfectly. It also served as another step in my Unity learning journey, reinforcing that leveraging external sources can be a valuable and time-saving strategy.
