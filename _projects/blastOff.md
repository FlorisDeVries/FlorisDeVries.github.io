**Blast Off!** was a project completed during the masterâ€™s course **Game Physics**, where [Niels Mulder](http://www.ncmulder.me) and I implemented a simulation of the solar system in Unity, using custom physics calculations. The project combined a physics-based space simulation with gameplay elements, resulting in both an educational tool and an engaging game.

### Gameplay and Features
- **Rocket Gameplay**: Players navigate a rocket from one planet to another, attempting to achieve a successful landing. For gameplay purposes, we simplified the simulation in this mode to make it more approachable and fun.
- **Sandbox Mode**: Players can create their own solar systems with full freedom. This includes adding multiple suns, planets, and objects to experiment with gravitational interactions.
- **Accurate Solar System Simulation**: In the simulation mode, planets followed physical laws, such as gravitational pull, resulting in an accurate representation of celestial mechanics.

### Technical Challenges
The project posed a number of mathematical and physics challenges, requiring us to:
- Simulate **gravitational forces** between celestial bodies.
- Account for **floating-point limitations**, which became significant when dealing with vast distances in space.
- Balance accuracy and performance for real-time simulation in Unity.

### Timeline and Outcome
This two-month project was completed under a tight deadline but exceeded our expectations. The final product featured an impressive space simulation that adhered to the laws of physics, as well as some basic gameplay. The project was well received for its combination of technical depth and fun gameplay.
