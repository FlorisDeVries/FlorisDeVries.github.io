**Car Tutor** was a special project I created as part of my family’s yearly "surprise" tradition. That year, I drew my younger brother, who had just started taking driving lessons. Inspired by his new challenge, I decided to create a playful game to "teach" him how to drive in a safe and forgiving virtual environment.

### The Game
The game mimics the basics of driving but adds a fun twist. Players control a car, collecting gems while avoiding obstacles like flaming barrels, trees, and other vehicles. The lighthearted gameplay was designed to provide an enjoyable, arcade-style driving experience.

### Lessons Learned and Challenges
This project was another important step in my Unity learning journey. Key takeaways included:
- **Visual Effects**: Using Unity’s Visual Effect Graph to create toon-style flames and other engaging visuals.
- **Physics Simulation**: Gaining hands-on experience with Unity’s physics system, including vehicle dynamics and collision handling.
- **Scope Management**: The game was intentionally kept small in scope, completed over weekends within a one-month timeline.

### Outcome
The project was well-received and served its purpose as a fun and personalized gift. It also helped me strengthen my understanding of Unity’s visual effects and physics systems, laying the groundwork for future projects.
