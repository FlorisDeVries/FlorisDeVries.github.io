## Project Overview
"Centurion" was a project designed to **improve my workflow for game development** after realizing inefficiencies during the development of **Temple of Bastet**. For this project, I focused on:
- Establishing an **efficient hierarchy/workflow in Unity**.
- Experimenting with a **low-poly 3D modeling style** that I could quickly create.
- Forcing myself to work without any **third-party art assets** while exploring the use of **third-party development packages** to streamline processes.

This project revolved around creating a simple ARPG with minimalistic combat mechanics:
- **Primary and secondary attacks** for the player character.
- **Hex-based maps** that acted as short dungeon floors, inspired by roguelike games.

While the game itself remained a prototype, the insights gained in terms of workflow and design will benefit future projects.

## Gameplay Features
### **In-World Main Menu**
One of the key experiments in this project was to create an **immersive main menu**. Instead of a traditional menu, players navigate and interact with the menu as part of the game world.

### **Exploration and Combat**
The gameplay was designed for **quick sessions**, with players navigating hex-based maps. Combat was intentionally minimalistic, with the following core mechanics:
- A **primary attack** (e.g., sword slash) and a **secondary ranged attack** (e.g., whirlwind).
- Movement-based dodging and strategic positioning.

## Reflection
This project successfully achieved its primary goals:
- **Efficient Workflow**: I now have a reusable Unity template that streamlines development for future projects.
- **Low-Poly Art Style**: I gained confidence in creating low-poly 3D assets, though I recognize thereâ€™s still room to improve in certain areas like texturing and animation.
- **In-World Menus**: This experiment was successful and could add immersion to future games.
