The **Compute Shaders** project was a personal exploration into optimizing rendering techniques, specifically ray and path tracing, using Unity. Building on my knowledge from the *Advanced Graphics* course, this project allowed me to dive deeper into **compute shaders** and their potential for GPU acceleration.

### Project Overview
To get started, I followed [this comprehensive tutorial](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/gpu-ray-tracing-in-unity-part-1) on implementing ray and path tracing in Unity. After completing the tutorial, I expanded upon the initial framework to include additional techniques and features:
- **Beer's Law**: Simulated light absorption for realistic rendering of transparent objects.
- **Reflections and Refractions**: Enhanced light behavior at material boundaries.
- **Skybox Integration**: Added a skybox for realistic environmental lighting.
- **Improved Scene Structure**: Organized the Unity project with **scriptable objects** to allow easy swapping of scenes and rendering techniques.

### Key Learnings
This project taught me valuable lessons in Unity and rendering techniques, including:
- **Compute Shaders**: Leveraged the GPU for parallelized ray and path tracing, achieving significant performance improvements compared to CPU-based methods.
- **Scriptable Objects**: Simplified data management in Unity, making the project more modular and scalable.
- **Rendering Optimization**: Applied concepts from my *Advanced Graphics* course to create a more efficient and visually stunning implementation.

### Screenshots and Renders
Below are some renders showcasing the capabilities of the ray and path tracers:

### Future Plans
While this project is complete for now, it serves as a solid foundation for further experimentation. I may revisit it in the future to explore additional features, optimizations, and rendering techniques.
