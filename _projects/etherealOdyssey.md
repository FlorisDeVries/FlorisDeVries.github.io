## Project Overview
**Ethereal Odyssey** builds on the workflow and lessons learned during the development of **Centurion**, focusing on streamlining development and creating a richer gameplay experience. The project incorporates:
- An **in-world menu** hub system as the **Nexus Atrium**, which serves as the player’s base of operations.
- **Hybrid combat mechanics**, blending active and passive combat systems for dynamic gameplay.
- **Roman mythology-inspired lore**, creating a fantasy version of the Roman Empire with unique characters and environments.

While the game is currently on hold, it represents a strong foundation for future continuation with refined lore and game design.

## Gameplay Features
### **Nexus Atrium: The In-World Hub**
The **Nexus Atrium** acts as a sanctuary for the player, connecting the overworld to the various temples. Key features include:
- **The Animus Obelisk**: A soul container that evolves as the player progresses, offering combat assistance and upgrades.
- **Realm Portals**: Allowing players to travel to corrupted temples.

### **Dynamic Combat System**
Combat combines **active player-driven abilities** with **passive assistance** from the Animus Obelisk. Key mechanics include:
- Attack combinations that create larger effects (e.g., fireballs igniting poison clouds).
- Elemental damage systems
- Core defense mechanics where players protect the Animus Obelisk during raids.

### **Skill Tree System**
To enhance gameplay progression, a custom **Skill Tree Editor Tool** was developed in Unity. This tool allows for easy creation and editing of abilities, streamlining future content creation.

## Reflection
This project successfully:
- Applied workflows and art styles developed in previous projects, saving time and resources.
- Expanded technical skills in **custom Unity tools** like the Skill Tree Editor.
- Experimented with hybrid combat mechanics, blending active and passive gameplay.

While the game was put on hold to refine its lore and overall design, **Ethereal Odyssey** remains a strong foundation for future development.
