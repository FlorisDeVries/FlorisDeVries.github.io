**Dodger** was a week-long solo project during the Game Design minor, where I was challenged to create, finish, and publish a game entirely on my own. This assignment focused on personal development, and for me, that meant tackling the often-overlooked final stages of game developmentâ€”publishing. The goal was clear: build and publish a fully functioning game within a tight one-week deadline.

### The Game
Dodger is a simple survival game where players control a ball inside a square arena, dodging an invasion of other balls. While the premise may be lighthearted and intentionally simplistic, the primary focus of this project was completing and publishing the game rather than the complexity of its design.

### Challenges and Skills Learned
Publishing a game came with its own unique challenges, such as:
- **Building for Android**: Ensuring the game ran smoothly on mobile devices.
- **Touch Input**: Designing and implementing intuitive controls that worked seamlessly with both touch and mouse inputs.
- **Google Play Store Publishing**: Learning the process of uploading the game to the Google Play Store and using the developer portal.

Despite the tight timeline, I successfully published the game. And although **Dodger** is no longer available on the Google Play Store, the experience was invaluable in teaching me the importance of polishing and finishing projects. This marked a significant milestone in my journey with Unity, where I gained a deeper understanding of what it takes to deliver a complete product.

The source code for the game can still be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/FlorisDeVries/Dodger).
