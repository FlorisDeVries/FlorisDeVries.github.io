“Legacy Rogue” was the first collaborative game project I worked on during my bachelor’s degree, taking place in the first semester of college. This 4-month project introduced the challenge of working in a team of five under a strict timeline, where we learned to balance scope and quality.

Our task was to modernize an old game by enhancing one specific aspect. We chose the classic game “Rogue” and upgraded its visuals with 2.5D graphics and sprites.

My primary role focused on the technical aspects, where I honed my skills in:
- C#
- Pathfinding algorithms (e.g., A*)
- Code design patterns
- Source control for effective collaboration

The project culminated in a successful demo during the bachelor’s open day, where guests had the opportunity to test the game and provide valuable feedback.
