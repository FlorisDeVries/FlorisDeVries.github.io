## Project Overview
"Rogue Flick" was a month-long experimental project where I focused on exploring a fun and novel combat system. Taking inspiration from my earlier **Dodger** game, I wanted to experiment with controls that combined both touch and mouse inputs in a seamless and intuitive way.

The concept revolves around the player controlling a ball that can be "flicked" into enemies to deal damage. Over the course of the project, I created three prototypes, each testing different variations of the flick mechanic. The goal was to test and iterate quickly, while also enhancing the **game feel** with small **VFX effects** and snappy interactions.

## Development Highlights
- **Input Mechanics:** Designed the flick mechanic to work seamlessly with both mouse and touch inputs.
- **Game Feel Enhancements:** Added subtle VFX, like trails and collision effects, to make the mechanic feel more impactful and satisfying.
- **Prototyping Focus:** Prioritized quick iteration cycles to explore what made the flick mechanic enjoyable.

While I am happy with the final prototype, I decided not to expand it into a full game as I didnâ€™t feel inspired to build further systems around the concept.

## Reflection
This project served as a great opportunity to explore innovative gameplay mechanics in a short amount of time. It also reinforced the importance of **iterative design** and focusing on **player feedback and game feel** when developing unique controls.

While the prototypes won't evolve into a full game I did learn from experimenting with hybrid input systems and VFX.
