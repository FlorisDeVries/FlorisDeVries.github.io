# About Me

I am Master's student at Utrecht University, currently enrolled in the Game and Media Technology MSc programme. I have already finsished my BSc in computer science where I learnt mostly about working with C# and Unity. During that time I also aqcuired some skills in the Game Design part of Game Development by doing a minor at the HKU followed by some passion projects.
Even though I mostly learned about C# and Unity I also had some practice with other languages during the BSc. A short summary of these languages would be: Python, Haskell and Kotlin.
During the master's programme C++ was introduced to me and even though I'm becoming more and more proficient with the language it still doesn't feel natural to program with it.
With these languages I have completed a wide variety of projects from training some agent to walk with AI to implementing an interactive real-time ray tracer and path tracer.

When I'm not busy working or studying I love to play some games or watch some series. Rocket league will always be some kind of weird passion, I mean... who doesn't love ramming their car into a ball and then flying off with it?
