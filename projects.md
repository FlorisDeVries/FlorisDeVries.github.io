# Current Projects

## [PTSWGD](https://hdjkleissen.github.io/PTSWGD/)<image src="/assets/images/ptswgd.png" height="100" align="right"/>
[PTSWGD](https://hdjkleissen.github.io/PTSWGD/) is a group of (former) CS students working together to develop a game in Unity. I'm part of both the development team and the game design team, training my C#/Unity skills and my Game Design skills at the same time!

# Games and gamejams

## Blast Off!
Together with [Niels Mulder](http://www.ncmulder.me), I implemented a simulation of the solar system in Unity(with our own physics). To make the "game" a game we also created a level system where the player has to try and shoot a rocket from one planet to another within a less accurate simulation... Would be waaaay to difficult to play otherwise :). And as a cherry on the cake we also included a sandbox mode in which you can try and create your very own solar system! You could even try to make one with multiple suns?? Check it out [here](https://github.com/FlorisDeVries/INFOMGP_Project)!

## Dodger
This is a solo project where I tried making a really simple game within a limited amount of time with the sole purpose of actually publishing a game! Well guess what: I both somewhat finished the game as well as published it to the play store!
The game is about a ball trying to survive an invasion of balls in his simple square house. I know right? Impeccable story writing and game desing right there!

## Mars Walker
Together with [Roxanne Giling](https://github.com/Roxanne13579), I created a Mars exploration game where the player controls curiosity and has to research some rocks on mars... Exciting right? Well there might just be something more to it...
